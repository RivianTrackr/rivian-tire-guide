# Changelog

All notable changes to the Rivian Tire Guide plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Star ratings showing 0** — Frontend was not passing the nonce with `get_tire_ratings` AJAX requests, causing the new CSRF check to reject rating fetches for logged-in users.
- **Broken images on comparison page** — `safeImageURL()` was hardcoding a CDN optimization prefix on every validated URL. Now returns the validated URL directly.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Schema.org structured data** — Automatic JSON-LD output (Product + AggregateRating + ItemList) on pages using the `[rivian_tire_guide]` shortcode for SEO rich snippets.
- **Rate limiting on rating submissions** — Transient-based limiter (10 submissions per 60-second window per user) to prevent abuse.
- **Tire existence validation** — Rating submissions now verify the tire exists in the database before saving.
- **Nonce verification on `get_tire_ratings`** — Logged-in users' read requests are now CSRF-protected.
- **Content-Security-Policy headers** — The standalone comparison page now sends `CSP`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy` headers.
- **URL validation in comparison page** — Image, affiliate, and bundle link URLs are now validated through `safeImageURL()` and `safeLinkURL()` domain allowlists with `escapeHTML()` applied to all attributes.
- **CSS injection prevention** — Theme color values are re-validated with `sanitize_hex_color()` at render time in both the frontend shortcode and comparison template.
- **README.md** — Comprehensive project documentation.
- **CHANGELOG.md** — Version history.
- **SECURITY.md** — Security policy and responsible disclosure instructions.

### Fixed
- **XSS in comparison page** — Link and image URLs were inserted into HTML attributes without escaping. All dynamic values now pass through `escapeHTML()` and domain-validated URL functions.
- **Uninstall cleanup** — Added `delete_option('rtg_dropdown_options')` to the uninstall handler to remove all plugin data on deletion.
- **Bundle link hover state** — Fixed `onmouseout` color not changing (was identical to `onmouseover`).

### Security
- 8 security improvements addressing CSRF, XSS, rate limiting, CSP, CSS injection, and data validation. See the individual items above for details.
